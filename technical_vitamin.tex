\chapter{Conditional variational autoencoders for detecting real GW signals}

In this chapter I will discuss some recent soon to be published work on using the \texttt{VItamin} machine learning for gravitational wave parameter estimation pipeline to do Bayesian PE on real \ac{GW} signals. In the first section I will introduce the problem, in the second I will discuss data pre-processing and generation, in the third section I will discuss results in both real and Gaussian noise cases on a variety of real \ac{GW} signals.
