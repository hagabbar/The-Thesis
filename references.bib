ABSTRACT={We review the main physical processes that lead to the formation of stellar binary black holes (BBHs) and to their merger. BBHs can form from the isolated evolution of massive binary stars. The physics of core-collapse supernovae and the process of common envelope are two of the main sources of uncertainty about this formation channel. Alternatively, two black holes can form a binary by dynamical encounters in a dense star cluster. The dynamical formation channel leaves several imprints on the mass, spin and orbital properties of BBHs.}

Advanced Virgo will be part of a network, alongside the two Advanced LIGO detectors in the US and GEO HF in Germany, with the goal of contributing to the early detection of gravitational waves and to opening a new window of observation on the universe. In this paper we describe the main features of the Advanced Virgo detector and outline the status of the construction.}

abstract = {Data normalization is one of the pre-processing approaches where the data is either scaled or transformed to make an equal contribution of each feature. The success of machine learning algorithms depends upon the quality of the data to obtain a generalized predictive model of the classification problem. The importance of data normalization for improving data quality and subsequently the performance of machine learning algorithms has been presented in many studies. But, the work lacks for the feature selection and feature weighting approaches, a current research trend in machine learning for improving performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of fourteen data normalization methods on classification performance considering full feature set, feature selection, and feature weighting. In this paper, we also present a modified Ant Lion optimization that search feature subsets and the best feature weights along with the parameter of Nearest Neighbor Classifier. Experiments are performed on 21 publicly available real and synthetic datasets, and results are analyzed based on the accuracy, the percentage of feature reduced and runtime. It has been observed from the results that no single method outperforms others. Therefore, we have suggested a set of the best and the worst methods combining the normalization procedure and empirical analysis of results. The better performers are z-Score and Pareto Scaling for the full feature set and feature selection, and tanh and its variant for feature weighting. The worst performers are Mean Centered, Variable Stability Scaling and Median and Median Absolute Deviation methods along with un-normalized data.}

	abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.}

Starting from the very first Michelson interferometer to today's large-scale gravitational wave observatories, the peak sensitivity of the Michelson interferometer has improved by about 10 orders of magnitude. Advanced gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO or Advanced Virgo, will achieve a measurement precision limited by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, giving rise to the interferometric Standard Quantum Limit for 40 kg test masses.

	abstract = {Einstein's special theory of relativity revolutionized physics by teaching us that space and time are not separate entities, but join as ‘spacetime’. His general theory of relativity further taught us that spacetime is not just a stage on which dynamics takes place, but is a participant: the field equation of general relativity connects matter dynamics to the curvature of spacetime. Curvature is responsible for gravity, carrying us beyond the Newtonian conception of gravity that had been in place for the previous two and a half centuries. Much research in gravitation since then has explored and clarified the consequences of this revolution; the notion of dynamical spacetime is now firmly established in the toolkit of modern physics. Indeed, this notion is so well established that we may now contemplate using spacetime as a tool for other sciences. One aspect of dynamical spacetime—its radiative character, ‘gravitational radiation’—will inaugurate entirely new techniques for observing violent astrophysical processes. Over the next 100 years, much of this subject's excitement will come from learning how to exploit spacetime as a tool for astronomy. This paper is intended as a tutorial in the basics of gravitational radiation physics.}

This method is applied to data of interferometric detectors such as Virgo.

The main characteristics of the method are its simplicity and the strong reduction of the computing time needed for the analysis and in particular for all the simulation procedures. We also introduce here the concept of ‘coherence’ to state the reliability of a detection.}

We constrain properties of the BBH mass spectrum using models with a range of parameterizations of the BBH mass and spin distributions. We find that the mass distribution of the more massive BH in such binaries is well approximated by models with no more than 1% of BHs more massive than 45 and a power-law index of α =  (90% credibility). We also show that BBHs are unlikely to be composed of BHs with large spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Modeling the evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift, we show that it is flat or increasing with redshift with 93% probability. Marginalizing over uncertainties in the BBH population, we find robust estimates of the BBH merger rate density of R =  Gpc−3 yr−1 (90% credibility). As the BBH catalog grows in future observing runs, we expect that uncertainties in the population model parameters will shrink, potentially providing insights into the formation of BHs via supernovae, binary interactions of massive stars, stellar cluster dynamics, and the formation history of BHs across cosmic time.}

We consider three different cases: (i) the ‘classic’ case of a star spinning about a principal axis; (ii) a biaxial star, not spinning about a principal axis; (iii) a triaxial star spinning steady, but not about a principal axis [as described by Jones]. The first of these emits only at one frequency; the other two at a pair of harmonically related frequencies. We show that in all three cases, when written in terms of the original ‘source parameters’, there exist a number of discrete degeneracies, with different parameter values giving rise to the same gravitational wave signal. We show how these can be removed by suitably restricting the source parameter ranges. In the case of the model as written down by Jones, there is also a continuous degeneracy. We show how to remove this through a suitable rewriting in terms of ‘waveform parameters’, chosen so as to make the specializations to the other stellar models particularly simple. We briefly consider the (non-trivial) relation between the assignments of prior probabilities on one set of parameters verses the other. The results of this paper will be of use when designing strategies for carrying out searches for such multiharmonic gravitational wave signals, and when performing parameter estimation in the event of a detection.}",

Quality improvement of interferometric data collected by gravitational-wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo is mission critical for the success
of gravitational-wave astrophysics. Gravitational-wave detectors are sensitive to a
variety of disturbances of non-astrophysical origin with characteristic frequencies in
the instrument band of sensitivity. Removing non-astrophysical artifacts that corrupt the data stream is crucial for increasing the number and statistical significance
of gravitational-wave detections and enabling refined astrophysical interpretations of
the data. Machine learning has proved to be a powerful tool for analysis of massive
quantities of complex data in astronomy and related fields of study. We present two
machine learning methods, based on random forest and genetic programming algorithms, that can be used to determine the origin of non-astrophysical transients in the
LIGO detectors. We use two classes of transients with known instrumental origin that
were identified during the first observing run of Advanced LIGO to show that the
algorithms can successfully identify the origin of non-astrophysical transients in real
interferometric data and thus assist in the mitigation of instrumental and environmental disturbances in gravitational-wave searches. While the datasets described in this
paper are specific to LIGO, and the exact procedures employed were unique to the
same, the random forest and genetic programming code bases and means by which
they were applied as a dual machine learning approach are completely portable to any
number of instruments in which noise is believed to be generated through mechanical
couplings, the source of which is not yet discovered.

abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending has grown rapidly in the past years. Therefore, borrowers and lenders are provided with the opportunity of lending and borrowing independently of the banks. Lenders in the P2P lending market can share their total investment amount among different loans, so making a decision may be difficult for inexpert lenders. The aim of this study is to propose a novel decision-making framework in which instance-based learning as a lazy learning method and artificial neural networks as an eager learning approach are integrated. The proposed hybrid instance-based learning (HIBL) model has the ability to predict the return and risk of new loans and help investors to find the optimal portfolio. In order to check the effectiveness of our model, we use a real-world dataset from one of the most popular P2P lending marketplaces, namely Lending Club. Moreover, a comparison among our proposed model and a rating-based method reveals that the proposed HIBL model can improve investments in P2P lending.},

Deep learning, as an emerging branch from machine learning, has exhibited unprecedented performance in quite a few applications from academia and industry. We highlight the difference and similarity in widely utilized models in deep learning studies, through discussing their basic structures, and reviewing diverse applications and disadvantages. We anticipate the work can serve as a meaningful perspective for further development of its theory, algorithm and application in bioinformatic and computational biology.}

In fact, these networks can approximate functions that are not differentiable in the classical sense, but possess only a generalized derivative, as is the case for certain piecewise differentiable functions. The conditions imposed on the hidden layer activation function are relatively mild; the conditions imposed on the domain of the function to be approximated have practical implications. Our approximation results provide a previously missing theoretical justification for the use of multilayer feedforward networks in applications requiring simultaneous approximation of a function and its derivatives.}

Here, we show that a universally applicable force field for phosphorus can be created by machine learning (ML) from a suitably chosen ensemble of quantum-mechanical results. Our model is fitted to density-functional theory plus many-body dispersion (DFT + MBD) data; its accuracy is demonstrated for the exfoliation of black and violet phosphorus (yielding monolayers of “phosphorene” and “hittorfene”); its transferability is shown for the transition between the molecular and network liquid phases. An application to a phosphorene nanoribbon on an experimentally relevant length scale exemplifies the power of accurate and flexible ML-driven force fields for next-generation materials modelling. The methodology promises new insights into phosphorus as well as other structurally complex, e.g., layered solids that are relevant in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science.},

While computationally efficient density-functional approximations (DFAs) have become essential tools in computational chemistry, their (semi-)local treatment of electron correlation has a number of well-known pathologies, e.g. related to electron self-interaction. Here, we present a type of machine-learning (ML) based DFA (termed Kernel Density Functional Approximation, KDFA) that is pure, non-local and transferable, and can be efficiently trained with fully quantitative reference methods. The functionals retain the mean-field computational cost of common DFAs and are shown to be applicable to non-covalent, ionic and covalent interactions, as well as across different system sizes. We demonstrate their remarkable possibilities by computing the free energy surface for the protonated water dimer at hitherto unfeasible gold-standard coupled cluster quality on a single commodity workstation.},

abstract = {This work investigates the detection of binary neutron stars gravitational wave based on convolutional neural network (CNN). To promote the detection performance and efficiency, we proposed a scheme based on wavelet packet (WP) decomposition and CNN. The WP decomposition is a time-frequency method and can enhance the discriminant features between gravitational wave signal and noise before detection. The CNN conducts the gravitational wave detection by learning a function mapping relation from the data under being processed to the space of detection results. This function-mapping-relation style detection scheme can detection efficiency significantly. In this work, instrument effects are considered, and the noise are computed from a power spectral density (PSD) equivalent to the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. The quantitative evaluations and comparisons with the state-of-art method matched filtering show the excellent performances for BNS gravitational wave detection. On efficiency, the current experiments show that this WP-CNN-based scheme is more than 960 times faster than the matched filtering.},

ABSTRACT={Only a few years after the first detection of gravitational waves from coalescing stellar-mass black holes, the field of gravitational-wave astronomy is now firmly established after the detection of several more. These discoveries have opened up a new window onto the universe, which allows us to probe gravity and astrophysics in some of the most extreme environments in the universe. The detection and, in particular, the subsequent inference of the binaries' properties rely heavily on theoretical models of the signals. In this review, we first discuss the techniques used to model the gravitational-wave signals from coalescing black holes, before we summarize the observations made to date. We conclude with a brief outlook onto the prospects for binary black hole observations in the future.}

abstract = {The groundbreaking discoveries of gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers [1], [2], [3] and, most recently, coalescing neutron stars [4] started a new era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and revolutionized our understanding of the Cosmos. Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are already transforming many technological fields and have also proven successful in gravitational-wave astrophysics for detection and characterization of gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes [5], [6], [7]. Here we use a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify transient gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers in noisy time series representative of typical gravitational-wave detector data. Specifically, we show that a deep convolution neural network trained on 100,000 data samples can promptly identify binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals and distinguish them from noise and signals from merging black hole binaries. These results demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks for real-time detection of gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers, which is critical for a prompt follow-up and detailed observation of the electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying these important transients.}

	abstract = {The fourth science run of the LIGO and GEO 600 gravitational-wave detectors, carried out in early 2005, collected data with significantly lower noise than previous science runs. We report on a search for short-duration gravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the 64–1600 Hz frequency range appearing in all three LIGO interferometers. Signal consistency tests, data quality cuts and auxiliary-channel vetoes are applied to reduce the rate of spurious triggers. No gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 days of live observation time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 0.15 day−1 (at 90% confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to be detected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized using Monte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previous searches. We also provide rough estimates of the distances at which representative supernova and binary black hole merger signals could be detected with 50% efficiency by this analysis.}

This article reviews the seismic isolation strategy and instrumentation developed for the Advanced LIGO observatories. It summarizes over a decade of research on active inertial isolation and shows the performance recently achieved at the Advanced LIGO observatories. The paper emphasizes the scientific and technical challenges of this endeavor and how they have been addressed. An overview of the isolation strategy is given. It combines multiple layers of passive and active inertial isolation to provide suitable rejection of seismic noise at all frequencies. A detailed presentation of the three active platforms that have been developed is given. They are the hydraulic pre-isolator, the single-stage internal isolator and the two-stage internal isolator. The architecture, instrumentation, control scheme and isolation results are presented for each of the three systems. Results show that the seismic isolation sub-system meets Advanced LIGO’s stringent requirements and robustly supports the operation of the two detectors.}

abstract = {We review detection methods that are currently in use or have been proposed to search for a stochastic background of gravitational radiation. We consider both Bayesian and frequentist searches using ground-based and space-based laser interferometers, spacecraft Doppler tracking, and pulsar timing arrays; and we allow for anisotropy, non-Gaussianity, and non-standard polarization states. Our focus is on relevant data analysis issues, and not on the particular astrophysical or early Universe sources that might give rise to such backgrounds. We provide a unified treatment of these searches at the level of detector response functions, detection sensitivity curves, and, more generally, at the level of the likelihood function, since the choice of signal and noise models and prior probability distributions are actually what define the search. Pedagogical examples are given whenever possible to compare and contrast different approaches.We have tried to make the article as self-contained and comprehensive as possible, targeting graduate students and new researchers looking to enter this field.},

abstract = "Objectives
The purpose of this study was to validate a patch-based image denoising method for ultra-low-dose CT images. Neural network with convolutional auto-encoder and pairs of standard-dose CT and ultra-low-dose CT image patches were used for image denoising. The performance of the proposed method was measured by using a chest phantom.
Materials and methods
Standard-dose and ultra-low-dose CT images of the chest phantom were acquired. The tube currents for standard-dose and ultra-low-dose CT were 300 and 10 mA, respectively. Ultra-low-dose CT images were denoised with our proposed method using neural network, large-scale nonlocal mean, and block-matching and 3D filtering. Five radiologists and three technologists assessed the denoised ultra-low-dose CT images visually and recorded their subjective impressions of streak artifacts, noise other than streak artifacts, visualization of pulmonary vessels, and overall image quality.
Results
For the streak artifacts, noise other than streak artifacts, and visualization of pulmonary vessels, the results of our proposed method were statistically better than those of block-matching and 3D filtering (p-values < 0.05). On the other hand, the difference in the overall image quality between our proposed method and block-matching and 3D filtering was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.07272). The p-values obtained between our proposed method and large-scale nonlocal mean were all less than 0.05.
Conclusion
Neural network with convolutional auto-encoder could be trained using pairs of standard-dose and ultra-low-dose CT image patches. According to the visual assessment by radiologists and technologists, the performance of our proposed method was superior to that of large-scale nonlocal mean and block-matching and 3D filtering."

abstract="The article reviews the statistical theory of signal detection in application to analysis of deterministic gravitational-wave signals in the noise of a detector. Statistical foundations for the theory of signal detection and parameter estimation are presented. Several tools needed for both theoretical evaluation of the optimal data analysis methods and for their practical implementation are introduced. They include optimal signal-to-noise ratio, Fisher matrix, false alarm and detection probabilities, {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal F{\}}{\$}-statistic, template placement, and fitting factor. These tools apply to the case of signals buried in a stationary and Gaussian noise. Algorithms to efficiently implement the optimal data analysis techniques are discussed. Formulas are given for a general gravitational-wave signal that includes as special cases most of the deterministic signals of interest.",

	journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
	abstract = {Based on the prior O1–O2 observing runs, about 30% of the data collected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo in the next observing runs are expected to be single-interferometer data, i.e. they will be collected at times when only one detector in the network is operating in observing mode. Searches for gravitational-wave signals from supernova events do not rely on matched filtering techniques because of the stochastic nature of the signals. If a Galactic supernova occurs during single-interferometer times, separation of its unmodelled gravitational-wave signal from noise will be even more difficult due to lack of coherence between detectors. We present a novel machine learning method to perform single-interferometer supernova searches based on the standard LIGO-Virgo coherent WaveBurst pipeline. We show that the method may be used to discriminate Galactic gravitational-wave supernova signals from noise transients, decrease the false alarm rate of the search, and improve the supernova detection reach of the detectors.}

	abstract = {We present two search algorithms that implement logarithmic tiling of the time–frequency plane in order to efficiently detect astrophysically unmodelled bursts of gravitational radiation. The first is a straightforward application of the dyadic wavelet transform. The second is a modification of the windowed Fourier transform which tiles the time–frequency plane for a specific Q. In addition, we also demonstrate adaptive whitening by linear prediction, which greatly simplifies our statistical analysis. This is a methodology paper that aims to describe the techniques for identifying significant events as well as the necessary pre-processing that is required in order to improve their performance. For this reason we use simulated LIGO noise in order to illustrate the methods and to present their preliminary performance.}

The reasons for this effectiveness are largely unknown.

  abstract={We describe the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from compact-object binary coalescences in advanced gravitational-wave detector data. The search was used in the first Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) observing run and unambiguously identified two black hole binary mergers, GW150914 and GW151226. At its core, the PyCBC search performs a matched-filter search for binary merger signals using a bank of gravitational-wave template waveforms. We provide a complete description of the search pipeline including the steps used to mitigate the effects of noise transients in the data, identify candidate events and measure their statistical significance. The analysis is able to measure false-alarm rates as low as one per million years, required for confident detection of signals. Using data from initial LIGO's sixth science run, we show that the new analysis reduces the background noise in the search, giving a ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/33/21/215004/cqgaa3f42ieqn1.gif] {$30 \% $} increase in sensitive volume for binary neutron star systems over previous searches.}

  abstract={Gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries are searched for using the matched filtering technique. As the model waveform depends on a number of parameters, it is necessary to filter the data through a template bank covering the astrophysically interesting region of the parameter space. The choice of templates is defined by the maximum allowed drop in signal-to-noise ratio due to the discreteness of the template bank. In this paper we describe the template-bank algorithm that was used in the analysis of data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and GEO 600 detectors to search for signals from binaries consisting of non-spinning compact objects. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study the efficiency of the bank and show that its performance is satisfactory for the design sensitivity curves of ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors GEO 600, initial LIGO, advanced LIGO and Virgo. The bank is efficient in searching for various compact binaries such as binary primordial black holes, binary neutron stars, binary black holes, as well as a mixed binary consisting of a non-spinning black hole and a neutron star.}

	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {Autonomous gravitational-wave searches—fully automated analyses of data that run without human intervention or assistance—are desirable for a number of reasons. They are necessary for the rapid identification of gravitational-wave burst candidates, which in turn will allow for follow-up observations by other observatories and the maximum exploitation of their scientific potential. A fully automated analysis would also circumvent the traditional ‘by hand’ setup and tuning of burst searches that is both labourious and time consuming. We demonstrate a fully automated search with X-Pipeline, a software package for the coherent analysis of data from networks of interferometers for detecting bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and other astrophysical triggers. We discuss the methods X-Pipeline uses for automated running, including background estimation, efficiency studies, unbiased optimal tuning of search thresholds and prediction of upper limits. These are all done automatically via Monte Carlo with multiple independent data samples and without requiring human intervention. As a demonstration of the power of this approach, we apply X-Pipeline to LIGO data to compute the sensitivity to gravitational-wave emission associated with GRB 031108. We find that X-Pipeline is sensitive to signals approximately a factor of 2 weaker in amplitude than those detectable by the cross-correlation technique used in LIGO searches to date. We conclude with comments on the status of X-Pipeline as a fully autonomous, near-real-time-triggered burst search in the current LSC-Virgo Science Run.}

In many cases, the characteristic frequency of the emitted GW is directly related to the energy scale at which the GW source is operating in the early universe. Consequently, different GW detectors can probe different energy scales in the evolution of the universe. After a general introduction on the properties of a GW stochastic background of primordial origin, some examples of cosmological sources are presented, which may lead to observable GW signals.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration have cataloged eleven confidently detected gravitational-wave events during the first two observing runs of the advanced detector era. All eleven events were consistent with being from well-modeled mergers between compact stellar-mass objects: black holes or neutron stars. The data around the time of each of these events have been made publicly available through the gravitational-wave open science center. The entirety of the gravitational-wave strain data from the first and second observing runs have also now been made publicly available. There is considerable interest among the broad scientific community in understanding the data and methods used in the analyses. In this paper, we provide an overview of the detector noise properties and the data analysis techniques used to detect gravitational-wave signals and infer the source properties. We describe some of the checks that are performed to validate the analyses and results from the observations of gravitational-wave events. We also address concerns that have been raised about various properties of LIGO–Virgo detector noise and the correctness of our analyses as applied to the resulting data.}

@article{Akutsu2019,
abstract = {The recent detections of gravitational waves (GWs) reported by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations have made a significant impact on physics and astronomy. A global network of GW detectors will play a key role in uncovering the unknown nature of the sources in coordinated observations with astronomical telescopes and detectors. Here we introduce KAGRA, a new GW detector with two 3 km baseline arms arranged in an ‘L' shape. KAGRA's design is similar to the second generations of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, but it will be operating at cryogenic temperatures with sapphire mirrors. This low-temperature feature is advantageous for improving the sensitivity around 100 Hz and is considered to be an important feature for the third-generation GW detector concept (for example, the Einstein Telescope of Europe or the Cosmic Explorer of the United States). Hence, KAGRA is often called a 2.5-generation GW detector based on laser interferometry. KAGRA's first observation run is scheduled in late 2019, aiming to join the third observation run of the advanced LIGO–Virgo network. When operating along with the existing GW detectors, KAGRA will be helpful in locating GW sources more accurately and determining the source parameters with higher precision, providing information for follow-up observations of GW trigger candidates.},

We review the performance of these techniques and show how they have influenced the upgrades of other detectors worldwide. In the second half of the paper, we consider how GEO 600 continues to pioneer new techniques for future gravitational wave detectors. We describe some of the new methods in detail and present new results on how they improve the sensitivity and/or the stability of GEO 600 and possibly of future detectors.}

In August 2014, the LOSC published the full dataset from Initial LIGO's “S5” run at design sensitivity, the first such large-scale release and a valuable testbed to explore the use of LIGO data by non-LIGO researchers and by the public, and to help teach gravitational-wave data analysis to students across the world. In addition to serving the S5 data, the LOSC web portal (losc.ligo.org) now offers documentation, data-location and data-quality queries, tutorials and example code, and more. We review the mission and plans of the LOSC, focusing on the S5 data release.}

We report here, for the first time, measurements of the mechanical dissipation of coatings formed from alternating layers of Al2O3 and Ta2O5, and SiO2 and Al2O3, respectively, when applied to fused silica substrates. In addition, we report our measurements of the elastic properties of Al2O3/Ta2O5 and SiO2/Ta2O5 coatings, as the film elastic properties can significantly influence expected levels of coating thermal noise. In summary, our analysis suggests that SiO2/Ta2O5 coatings currently present the best option for future detectors from a thermal noise standpoint.}

However, the method does not agree with new estimation methods, direct approaches, when the loss is distributed inhomogeneously. We have checked the modal expansion and direct approaches experimentally using a mechanical oscillator, such as a mirror. The experiments showed that the modal expansion is invalid. On the other hand, the measured spectra are consistent with the direct approaches. We calculated the thermal noise of a real mirror with inhomogeneous loss using the direct approaches. This calculation showed that the thermal motions caused by loss in the reflective coating and at coil–magnet actuators are comparable with the sensitivity goals of future gravitational wave detector projects. In addition, according to our calculation, a mechanical loss may cause much larger or much smaller thermal motion than is expected in modal expansion, depending on the loss distribution. The thermal fluctuation caused by coating loss is about three times larger than the estimation of the modal expansion. The thermal motion of the coil–magnet actuators is 15 times smaller. This implies that, in order to discuss the research strategy for the thermal noise, in addition to the loss quantity represented by Q-values, one should identify the distribution of all the major loss origins and use direct approaches instead of depending on the conventional modal expansion method.}

@article{Kaminski2018,
abstract = {In the paper, we consider sequential decision problems with uncertainty, represented as decision trees. Sensitivity analysis is always a crucial element of decision making and in decision trees it often focuses on probabilities. In the stochastic model considered, the user often has only limited information about the true values of probabilities. We develop a framework for performing sensitivity analysis of optimal strategies accounting for this distributional uncertainty. We design this robust optimization approach in an intuitive and not overly technical way, to make it simple to apply in daily managerial practice. The proposed framework allows for (1) analysis of the stability of the expected-value-maximizing strategy and (2) identification of strategies which are robust with respect to pessimistic/optimistic/mode-favoring perturbations of probabilities. We verify the properties of our approach in two cases: (a) probabilities in a tree are the primitives of the model and can be modified independently; (b) probabilities in a tree reflect some underlying, structural probabilities, and are interrelated. We provide a free software tool implementing the methods described.},

The shear modulus of solid quark matter could be ~1032 ergs cm-3 if the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations observed are relevant to the eigenvalues of the center star oscillations.}

We discuss recent progress in the modeling of these processes and summarize most recent GW signal estimates. In addition, we present new results on the GW emission from postbounce convective overturn and protoneutron star g-mode pulsations based on axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic calculations. Galactic core-collapse supernovae are very rare events, but within 3–5 Mpc from Earth, the rate jumps to 1 in ∼2 years. Using the set of currently available theoretical gravitational waveforms, we compute upper-limit optimal signal-to-noise ratios based on current and advanced LIGO/GEO600/VIRGO noise curves for the recent SN 2008bk which exploded at ∼3.9 Mpc. While initial LIGOs cannot detect GWs emitted by core-collapse events at such a distance, we find that advanced LIGO-class detectors could put significant upper limits on the GW emission strength for such events. We study the potential occurrence of the various GW emission processes in particular supernova explosion scenarios and argue that the GW signatures of neutrino-driven, magneto-rotational, and acoustically-driven core-collapse SNe may be mutually exclusive. We suggest that even initial LIGOs could distinguish these explosion mechanisms based on the detection (or non-detection) of GWs from a galactic core-collapse supernova.}

  abstract={With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches , which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO’s first observing run.}

abstract = {The recent Nobel-prize-winning detections of gravitational waves from merging black holes and the subsequent detection of the collision of two neutron stars in coincidence with electromagnetic observations have inaugurated a new era of multimessenger astrophysics. To enhance the scope of this emergent field of science, we pioneered the use of deep learning with convolutional neural networks, that take time-series inputs, for rapid detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals. This approach, Deep Filtering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this article, we present the extension of Deep Filtering using real data from LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using continuous data streams from multiple LIGO detectors. We demonstrate for the first time that machine learning can detect and estimate the true parameters of real events observed by LIGO. Our results show that Deep Filtering achieves similar sensitivities and lower errors compared to matched-filtering while being far more computationally efficient and more resilient to glitches, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This unified framework for data analysis is ideally suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time.}

Many undesirable behaviors of backprop can be avoided with tricks that are rarely exposedin serious technical publications.

It is shown that most ``classical'' second-order methods are impractical for large neural networks. A few methods are proposed that do not have these limitations.",

  abstract={Non-Gaussian noise transients in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors increase the background in searches for short-duration and un-modeled signals. We describe a method for vetoing noise transients by ranking the statistical relationship between triggers in auxiliary channels that have negligible sensitivity to gravitational waves and putative gravitational-wave triggers in the detector output. The novelty of the algorithm lies in its hierarchical approach, which leads to a minimal set of veto conditions with high performance and low deadtime. After a given channel has been selected it is used to veto triggers from the detector output; then, the algorithm selects a new channel that performs well on the remaining triggers and the process is repeated. This method has been demonstrated to reduce the background in searches for transient gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations.}

The Web interface has an "expert" mode giving access to a wider range of parameters and allowing the use of custom databases. For users with locally installed software and database on Unix or Linux systems, the catalog may be accessed from a command-line interface. C-language functions to access specified parameters are also available. The catalog is updated from time to time to include new information.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {Ground-based gravitational wave interferometers such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) are susceptible to ground shaking from high-magnitude teleseismic events, which can interrupt their operation in science mode and significantly reduce their duty cycle. It can take several hours for a detector to stabilize enough to return to its nominal state for scientific observations. The down time can be reduced if advance warning of impending shaking is received and the impact is suppressed in the isolation system with the goal of maintaining stable operation even at the expense of increased instrumental noise. Here, we describe an early warning system for modern gravitational-wave observatories. The system relies on near real-time earthquake alerts provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Preliminary low latency hypocenter and magnitude information is generally available in 5 to 20 min of a significant earthquake depending on its magnitude and location. The alerts are used to estimate arrival times and ground velocities at the gravitational-wave detectors. In general, 90% of the predictions for ground-motion amplitude are within a factor of 5 of measured values. The error in both arrival time and ground-motion prediction introduced by using preliminary, rather than final, hypocenter and magnitude information is minimal. By using a machine learning algorithm, we develop a prediction model that calculates the probability that a given earthquake will prevent a detector from taking data. Our initial results indicate that by using detector control configuration changes, we could prevent interruption of operation from 40 to 100 earthquake events in a 6-month time-period.}

	abstract = {The malaria parasite, which is transmitted by several Anopheles mosquito species, requires more time to reach its human-transmissible stage than the average lifespan of a mosquito. Monitoring the species-specific age structure of mosquito populations is critical to evaluating the impact of vector control interventions on malaria risk. We developed a rapid, cost-effective surveillance method based on deep learning of mid-infrared spectra of mosquitoes{\textquoteright} cuticle that simultaneously identifies the species and the age of three main malaria vectors, in natural populations. Using over 40,000 ecologically and genetically diverse females, we could speciate and age grade An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, and An. coluzzii with up to 95\% accuracy. Further, our model learned the age of new populations with minimal sampling effort and detected the impact of control interventions on simulated mosquito populations, measured as a shift in their age structures. We anticipate our method to be applied to other arthropod vector-borne diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract="Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark Krizhevsky et al. [18]. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.",

  abstract={We describe the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from compact-object binary coalescences in advanced gravitational-wave detector data. The search was used in the first Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) observing run and unambiguously identified two black hole binary mergers, GW150914 and GW151226. At its core, the PyCBC search performs a matched-filter search for binary merger signals using a bank of gravitational-wave template waveforms. We provide a complete description of the search pipeline including the steps used to mitigate the effects of noise transients in the data, identify candidate events and measure their statistical significance. The analysis is able to measure false-alarm rates as low as one per million years, required for confident detection of signals. Using data from initial LIGO's sixth science run, we show that the new analysis reduces the background noise in the search, giving a ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/33/21/215004/cqgaa3f42ieqn1.gif] {$30 \% $} increase in sensitive volume for binary neutron star systems over previous searches.}

abstract = {Summary 1. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a simulation technique that has revolutionised the analysis of ecological data, allowing the fitting of complex models in a Bayesian framework. Since 2001, there have been nearly 200 papers using MCMC in publications of the Ecological Society of America and the British Ecological Society, including more than 75 in the journal Ecology and 35 in the Journal of Applied Ecology. 2. We have noted that many authors routinely ‘thin’ their simulations, discarding all but every kth sampled value; of the studies we surveyed with details on MCMC implementation, 40\% reported thinning. 3. Thinning is often unnecessary and always inefficient, reducing the precision with which features of the Markov chain are summarised. The inefficiency of thinning MCMC output has been known since the early 1990’s, long before MCMC appeared in ecological publications. 4. We discuss the background and prevalence of thinning, illustrate its consequences, discuss circumstances when it might be regarded as a reasonable option and recommend against routine thinning of chains unless necessitated by computer memory limitations.},

  abstract={Gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries are searched for using the matched filtering technique. As the model waveform depends on a number of parameters, it is necessary to filter the data through a template bank covering the astrophysically interesting region of the parameter space. The choice of templates is defined by the maximum allowed drop in signal-to-noise ratio due to the discreteness of the template bank. In this paper we describe the template-bank algorithm that was used in the analysis of data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and GEO 600 detectors to search for signals from binaries consisting of non-spinning compact objects. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study the efficiency of the bank and show that its performance is satisfactory for the design sensitivity curves of ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors GEO 600, initial LIGO, advanced LIGO and Virgo. The bank is efficient in searching for various compact binaries such as binary primordial black holes, binary neutron stars, binary black holes, as well as a mixed binary consisting of a non-spinning black hole and a neutron star.}

In August 2014, the LOSC published the full dataset from Initial LIGO's “S5” run at design sensitivity, the first such large-scale release and a valuable testbed to explore the use of LIGO data by non-LIGO researchers and by the public, and to help teach gravitational-wave data analysis to students across the world. In addition to serving the S5 data, the LOSC web portal (losc.ligo.org) now offers documentation, data-location and data-quality queries, tutorials and example code, and more. We review the mission and plans of the LOSC, focusing on the S5 data release.}

@article{Hawking1972,
abstract = {It is assumed that the singularities which occur in gravitational collapse are not visible from outside but are hidden behind an event horizon. This means that one can still predict the future outside the event horizon. A black hole on a spacelike surface is defined to be a connected component of the region of the surface bounded by the event horizon. As time increase, black holes may merge together but can never bifurcate. A black hole would be expected to settle down to a stationary state. It is shown that a stationary black hole must have topologically spherical boundary and must be axisymmetric if it is rotating. These results together with those of Israel and Carter go most of the way towards establishing the conjecture that any stationary black hole is a Kerr solution. Using this conjecture and the result that the surface area of black holes can never decrease, one can place certain limits on the amount of energy that can be extracted from black holes.},

The concurrent detection of electromagnetic emission from these events would greatly enhance the scientific return of these discoveries. We review the state of the art in modeling the electromagnetic signal of neutron star binary mergers across different phases of the merger and multiple wavelengths. We focus on those observables that provide the most sensitive diagnostics of the merger physics and the contribution to the synthesis of rapid neutron capture (r-process) elements in the Galaxy. We also outline expected future developments on the observational and theoretical sides of this rapidly evolving field. }

  abstract={With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches , which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO’s first observing run.}

The novelty of the algorithm lies in its hierarchical approach, which leads to a minimal set of veto conditions with high performance and low deadtime. After a given channel has been selected it is used to veto triggers from the detector output; then, the algorithm selects a new channel that performs well on the remaining triggers and the process is repeated. This method has been demonstrated to reduce the background in searches for transient gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations.}

By coupling the growing sample of BBH systems with population synthesis models, we can begin to constrain the parameters of such models and glean unprecedented knowledge about the inherent physical processes that underpin binary stellar evolution. In this study, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian model to mass measurements from a synthetic GW sample to constrain the physical prescriptions in population models and the relative fraction of systems generated from various channels. We employ population models of two canonical formation scenarios in our analysis—isolated binary evolution involving a common-envelope phase and dynamical formation within globular clusters—with model variations for different black hole natal kick prescriptions. We show that solely with chirp mass measurements, it is possible to constrain natal kick prescriptions and the relative fraction of systems originating from each formation channel with of confident detections. This framework can be extended to include additional formation scenarios, model parameters, and measured properties of the compact binary.}

% BNS Hubble constant paper
@article{Abbott2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. On 17 August 2017, the Advanced LIGO1 and Virgo2 detectors observed the gravitational-wave event GW170817-a strong signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system3. Less than two seconds after the merger, a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source4-6. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities7, resulting in the identification8-13 of an optical transient signal within about ten arcseconds of the galaxy NGC 4993. This detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves represents the first 'multi-messenger' astronomical observation. Such observations enable GW170817 to be used as a 'standard siren'14-18 (meaning that the absolute distance to the source can be determined directly from the gravitational-wave measurements) to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Here we report a measurement of the Hubble constant that combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using the electromagnetic data. In contrast to previous measurements, ours does not require the use of a cosmic 'distance ladder'19: the gravitational-wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be about 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This value is consistent with existing measurements20,21, while being completely independent of them. Additional standard siren measurements from future gravitationalwave sources will enable the Hubble constant to be constrained to high precision.},

    abstract = { Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. }

abstract = {From the Publisher:This is the first comprehensive treatment of feed-forward neural
networks from the perspective of statistical pattern recognition. After introducing
the basic concepts, the book examines techniques for modelling probability density
functions and the properties and merits of the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis
function network models. Also covered are various forms of error functions, principal
algorithms for error function minimalization, learning and generalization in neural
networks, and Bayesian techniques and their applications. Designed as a text, with
over 100 exercises, this fully up-to-date work will benefit anyone involved in the
fields of neural computation and pattern recognition.}

abstract = {Gravitational waves represent a new opportunity to study and interpret phenomena from the universe. In order to efficiently detect and analyze them, advanced and automatic signal processing and machine learning techniques could help to support standard tools and techniques. Another challenge relates to the large volume of data collected by the detectors on a daily basis, which creates a gap between the amount of data generated and effectively analyzed. In this paper, we propose two approaches involving deep auto-encoder models to analyze time series collected from Gravitational Waves detectors and provide a classification label (noise or real signal). The purpose is to discard noisy time series accurately and identify time series that potentially contain a real phenomenon. Experiments carried out on three datasets show that the proposed approaches implemented using the Apache Spark framework, represent a valuable machine learning tool for astrophysical analysis, offering competitive accuracy and scalability performances with respect to state-of-the-art methods.}
