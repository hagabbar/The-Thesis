% Family

I would first off like to thank my parents (Lisa and Kurt) for all 
that they've done for me. Without their constant support and encouragement 
over the course of my life, I would not be where I am today. Additionally, I would like to thank 
the rest of my family including my siblings (Mallory and Schuyler), as well as my grandfather (Evan Lewis).

% Friends

To my friends here in Glasgow, I can confidently say that the last 4 years have been some of the best 
of my life. I've had so many wonderful experiences with you all; from many nights out 
to the pub, camping/hiking trips, climbing and random get togethers. I will dearly miss 
having you all in one place, but I'm sure that our paths will cross at some point 
again in the near future.

A special thank you to my best friend Jennie Wright who is the best.

% Research advisors

To the many advisors that I've had over my short research career including: 
Prof. Marco Cavaglia, Dr. Florent Robinet, Dr. Soma Mukherjee, 
Dr. Andrew Lundgren, Prof. Ik Siong Heng and Dr. Chris Messenger. You have all
in your own way inspired me to continue in physics through to my PhD. A big 
thank you to my primary PhD advisor Chris, who has taught me more than 
I ever could have imagined I would learn. You really are a truly gifted and amazing 
advisor and I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you.
