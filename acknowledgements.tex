\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would first off like to thank my parents (Lisa Gabbard and Kurt Gabbard) for all that they've done for me. Without their constant encouragement growing up and to the present day I would not be where I am now. Additionally, I would like to thank the rest of my family including my siblings (Mallory and Schuyler), my grandfather (Evan Lewis). 

To the many advisors that I've had over my short research career including: Prof. Marco Cavaglia, Dr. Florent Robinet, Dr. Soma Mukherjee, Dr. Andrew Lundgren, Prof. Ik Siong Heng and Dr. Chris Messenger.
